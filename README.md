Welcome to the Term Extraction for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) project! This project uses cutting-edge deep learning techniques to extract aspect terms from hotel reviews, enabling powerful aspect-based sentiment analysis 🧠. Let's dive into the world of customer sentiments and reviews! 🌟

📚 Abstract
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a crucial tool for breaking down customer reviews into specific aspects, like room quality or service, and determining the sentiment associated with each aspect.

In this project, we designed a novel Term Extraction (TE) model using deep learning to extract aspect terms from 515,000 hotel reviews 🏨 collected across Europe 🌍. Our model uses linguistic features (such as part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) and contextual information from the surrounding text to accurately identify aspect terms.

Our technique improved F1 score by 2.5% over existing methods, showcasing the effectiveness of the model! 🎉

🗂️ Dataset: 515K Hotel Reviews in Europe:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe

The dataset consists of 515,000 hotel reviews, offering valuable insights for both aspect extraction and sentiment analysis. Here’s a breakdown of the data:

📋 **Data Fields**
**This dataset consists of various fields providing detailed information about hotel reviews. Below is a description of each field:**

Hotel_Address: The physical address of the hotel.
Review_Date: The date when the review was posted by the reviewer.
Average_Score: The average score of the hotel, calculated based on the most recent reviews.
Hotel_Name: The name of the hotel being reviewed.
Reviewer_Nationality: The nationality of the reviewer.
Negative_Review: Negative comments made by the reviewer, or "No Negative" if no negative review was provided.
Review_Total_Negative_Word_Counts: The total number of words in the negative review (if applicable).
Positive_Review: Positive comments made by the reviewer, or "No Positive" if no positive review was provided.
Review_Total_Positive_Word_Counts: The total number of words in the positive review (if applicable).
Reviewer_Score: The score given by the reviewer based on their overall experience at the hotel.
Total_Number_of_Reviews_Reviewer_Has_Given: The total number of reviews the reviewer has posted for different hotels.
Total_Number_of_Reviews: The total number of valid reviews received by the hotel.
Tags: Tags provided by the reviewer, which may include trip type, room type, or other descriptive details.
days_since_review: The number of days between the review date and the scrape date.
Additional_Number_of_Scoring: The number of instances where a guest provided a score without a written review.
lat: The latitude coordinate of the hotel location.
lng: The longitude coordinate of the hotel location.

⚙️ Methodology

Our Term Extraction (TE) method uses a deep learning model that combines:

Linguistic Features: Extracts aspect terms based on part-of-speech tags and dependency relations.
Contextual Data: Leverages nearby text to enhance the accuracy of term extraction.
By analyzing 515,000 reviews, we achieve top-notch accuracy in extracting aspect terms, improving the overall performance of ABSA systems. 📈

Our model significantly enhances aspect term extraction from hotel reviews, improving F1 score by 2.5% compared to previous methods! This means better identification of customer preferences and sentiment trends, across positive, negative, and neutral reviews.

But that's not all! We also evaluated our model using the BLEU score for assessing the quality of aspect term extraction. This measure helps evaluate how closely the extracted terms match the ground truth. 🌟

F1 Score: 🚀 2.5% improvement over existing techniques
BLEU Score: Consistently high, reflecting accurate aspect term extraction
